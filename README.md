# InstaLiker
 App to automate action of liking posts on Instagram
### About the app<br>
The app was built in order simulate the human action of liking Instagrams posts, so it was setup to like 300 posts or till it finds no more withe hearts to click. <br>
The 300 limitation is to not let Instagram algorithm dectect that the action is being performed by an automation solution avoinding this way to have users account blocked by Instagram, but user can run the app more than one time during the day.

Here is the screenshot
